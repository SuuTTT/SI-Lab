if we gamify the coding of a clustering/learning algorithm, we have these choices:
- coding as building deck : like the card game or auto chess, where the player builds a deck/army from pre-defined cards/units and watch the game engine run the rest. we just select the components and place them in order. the ground truth is set as the goal.
- there a these components: the game engine, configure system,  is seperated  .
- we can begin with exisiting alorithm, gamify them.
- this is a universal gamify framework, especially for current age of AI, visualizing how AI algo or agent complish the task.
